## Inspiration

As broke university students struggling to keep up with inflation, we're always trying to find the best deals on groceries. Being tight on time with studies, we discovered that it was challenging to find the best grocery prices efficiently, which inspired us to create the Inflator Raider app. We strongly believe in making software accessible to all, so creating accessibility settings was a priority for us.

## What it does

The Inflator Raider app incorporates the process of extracting historic prices of items and demonstrating the pattern observed in the rates. It also gives the user an idea of how much the product is being sold for, at different vendors along with an indication of increase or decrease in the item's price. This enables an option for user to price match it at the vendor at hand or purchase from the cheapest option.

The 4-CLICK process prioritizes respectful communication and presents content and functionality in ways that everyone can access and understand. A high emphasis has been put on Accessibility features for the app to enable seamless and widespread adaption, taken into account a diverse range of human perspectives, abilities, and backgrounds.

## How we built it
- Figma
- Flutter
- Python Flask
- Github
- APIs

## Challenges we ran into

A big challenge we faced was getting the technologies up and running on everyone's machines. However, we were able to help each other out and collaborate virtually to get everything running.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of how we collaborated within a very short timeframe to create an awesome app that tackles a real issue many people, including students, are facing. We were able to identify what needs to be done and split the workload efficiently to work well as a team.

## What we learned

We learned how to use tools and technologies like Flutter and Figma, and how to create an API in the backend and integrate it with the front end.

## What's next for Inflator Raider

- Incorporation of ML and AI to use the historic data and predict price minimas for the products. This would provide the user better clarity in the decision making process of whether to buy the product right now or can wait for the right opportunity.
- Visualize prices and items from different stores to find the best deal.
- Push notifications to notify users of sales.
